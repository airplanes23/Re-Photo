# Re-Photo
### **A photographer's tool for recapturing special moments**

Many a times have I learned a cool, new photography trick and nail the photos...but then life happens and I'm unable to practice photography for a period of time. When I'm able to return to it, I no longer remember how I captured those sick shots and find myself having to *re-learn* these concepts from the bottom.

With Re-Photo, I'm now able to *re-do* some of my best shots by uploading some of my favorite shots and taking note of all the key aspects of the process. Easily track:
- Aperture
- Shutter Speed
- ISO
- Lighting conditions
- Location
- Miscellaneous
